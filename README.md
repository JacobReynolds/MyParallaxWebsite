#MyWebsite
<p>This is my current personal website.<br>
It was inspired from parallax websites, but I ended up only using parallax in one spot.<br>
This was my first experience using this much JQuery, and I ended up really liking it.</p>

<p>The full site can be viewed <a href="http://www.jakereynolds.co">here</a>.</p>

#Design
<p>The user experience is a simple SPA, with a header, and four sections below each using 1/4 of the page width.</p>

<p>The programmer experience is much more involved.  Each section takes up one full page view height.<br>
Each section has it's own wrapper, with relative positioning, and a mix of realtive and absolute elements inside of it.</p>

<p>I tend to lean more towards using ID's when naming elements, any element used for than once is assigned a class.</p>

<p>The css naming conventions label each section by elementType#elementID (e.g. div#fullPage).<br>
This, to me, helps add an extra level of clarity in the css flow.</p>
