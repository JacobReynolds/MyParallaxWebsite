# MyWebsite
<p>This is my current personal website.<br>
It was inspired from parallax websites, but I ended up only using parallax in one spot.<br>
This was my first experience using this much JQuery, and I ended up really liking it.</p>

<p>The full site can be viewed <a href="http://www.jakereynolds.co>here</a>.</p>

<p>This website is still under development, please e-mail any suggestions, bugs, or comments to reyno511@umn.edu</p>
