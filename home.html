                    A notification system to let students know when the next train will be after they get out of class.  I use this for going between East and West bank, when I only have 15 minutes.  This application helps me know which will be faster.

                    An automated grade checker that will notify students when teachers update their grades.  This has saved my F5 key on many occassions, especially around midterms and finals.

                    The first Java application I wrote that wasn't for school.  A simple text-based program ran in the terminal to play a 2-player game of chess.

                    My first try at a personal website using AngularJS.  Eventually changed to using this design, but it was a very fun project to work on.
